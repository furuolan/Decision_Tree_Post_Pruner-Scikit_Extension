# Decision Tree Post Pruner (Sci-kit Learn Extension)
At the time this was written (9/12/17) Sci-kit Learn's DecisionTreeClassifier does not support error-reduction post pruning, which is an effective way to reduce overfitting and potentially improve testing accuracy.

* To create a new document press **Ctrl-n** or **click the @icon-plus-circle icon** in the toolbar
* Click the **@icon-bars icon** to open the Folder Browser manage files
* To change **Editor or Preview Themes**, click on the dropdown lists on the bottom right status bar:

* For **light editor themes** look at `visualstudio`, `github` or `xcode`  
* For **dark editor themes** look at `twilight`,`vscodedark`, `monokai`, `terminal`

# Markdown Features
This topic is meant to give you a very basic overview of how Markdown works, showing some of the most frequently used operations.

### Bold and Italic
This text **is bold**.  
This text *is italic*.  
This text ~~is struck out~~.

### Header Text
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6


### Line Continuation
By default Markdown **adds paragraphs at double line breaks**. Single line breaks by themselves are simply wrapped together into a single line. If you want to have **soft returns** that break a single line, add **two spaces at the end of the line**.

---

This line has a paragraph break at the end (empty line after).

Theses two lines should display as a single
line because there's no double space at the end.

The following line has a soft break at the end (two spaces at end)  
This line should be following on the very next line.

You can use **View -> Show Invisible Characters** to show all white space and returns.

---

### Links
[Help Builder Web Site](http://helpbuilder.west-wind.com/)

If you need additional image tags like targets or title attributes you can also embed HTML directly:

---

```markdown
Go the Help Builder sitest Wind site: 
<a href="http://west-wind.com/" target="top">Help Builder Site</a>.
```
---

### Images
Images are similar to links:

![Help Builder Web Site](https://helpbuilder.west-wind.com/Images/wwhelp_128.png)

You can embed images by pasting from the Clipboard (**ctrl-v**), using the @icon-image Image Dialog, or by dragging and dropping into the document from the the Folder Browser, or Explorer.

### Block Quotes
Block quotes are callouts that are great for adding notes or warnings into documentation.

> ### @icon-info-circle Headers break on their own
> Note that headers don't need line continuation characters as they are block elements and automatically break. Only text lines require the double spaces for single line breaks.

You can also use simple block quotes:

> **Note:** Block quotes can be used to highlight important ideas.

### Fontawesome Icons
Help Builder includes a custom syntax for FontAwesome icons in its templates. You can embed a `@ icon-` followed by a font-awesome icon name to automatically embed that icon without full HTML syntax.

@icon-gear Configuration


### Emojiis
You can also embed Emojiis into your markdown using the Emoji dialog or common 

:smile: :rage: :sweat: :point_down:

:-) :-( :-/ 

### HTML Markup
You can also embed plain HTML markup into the page if you like. For example, if you want full control over fontawesome icons you can use this:

This text can be **embedded** into Markdown:  

<i class="fa fa-refresh fa-spin fa-2x"></i> &nbsp;**Refresh Page**

### Unordered Lists
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3  

This text is part of the third item. Use two spaces at end of the the list item to break the line.

A double line break, breaks out of the list.

### Ordered Lists
If you want lines to break using soft returns use two
spaces at the end of a line. 

---

1. **Item 1**  
Item 1 is really something
2. **Item 2**  
Item two is really something else

---

If you want to lines to break using soft returns use to spaces at the end of a line. 

Now a nested list:

---
1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow  
    this algorithm:
---


### Inline Code
If you want to embed code in the middle of a paragraph of text to highlight a coding syntax or class/member name you can use inline code syntax:

```markdown
Inline code or member references  like `SomeMethod()` can be codified...
```
---

Inline code or member references  like `SomeMethod()` can be codified... You can use the `'{}'`** menu or **Ctrl-\`** to embed inline code.


### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting
Markdown supports code blocks syntax in a couple of ways:

Using and indented text block for code:

---

Some rendered text...

    // This is code by way of four leading spaces
    // or a leading tab
    int x = 0;
    string text = null;
    for(int i; i < 10; i++;) {
        text += text + "Line " + i;
    }

More text here

---

### Fenced Code Blocks
You can also use triple back ticks plus an optional coding language to support for syntax highlighting.

The following is C# code.

---

```csharp
// this code will be syntax highlighted
for(var i=0; i++; i < 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```    

Many languages are supported: html, xml, javascript, css, csharp, foxpro, vbnet, sql, python, ruby, php and many more. Use the Code drop down list to get a list of available languages.

You can also leave out the language to attempt auto-detection or use `txt` for plain text:

```txt
robocopy c:\temp\test d:\temp\test
```

### Footnotes
Footnotes can be embedded like this:

Here is some text that includes a Footnote [^1] in the middle of its text. And here's another footnote [^2]. The actual footnotes render on the very bottom of the page.

### Pipe Tables
[Pipe Tables](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/PipeTableSpecs.md) can be used to create simple single line tables:

---

|size | material     | color       |
|---- | ------------ | ------------|
|9    | leather      | brown **fox**  |
|10   | hemp canvas  | natural |
|11   | glass        | transparent |

> **Note:** Cell lines don't have to line up to render properly. Max columns in any row determines table columns for the entire table. Pipe tables also don't need leading and trailing pipes to render as tables, but make sure you check compatibility with your final rendering site.

### Grid Tables
[Grid Tables](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/GridTableSpecs.md) are a bit more flexible than Pipe Tables in that they can have multiple lines of text per cell and handle multi-line embedded Markdown text.

+---------+---------+
| Header  | Header  |
| Column1 | Column2 |
+=========+=========+
| 1. ab   | > This is a quote
| 2. cde  | > For the second column 
| 3. f    |
+---------+---------+
| Second row spanning

> ### @icon-info-circle Use the @icon-table Table Editor 
> For easier table data entry and pretty rendered tables you can use the table editor which provides grid based table data entry. You can use the table editor with **Pipe**, **Grid** and **HTML** tables.
